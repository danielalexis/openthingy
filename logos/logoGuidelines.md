# Logo Design Guidelines

We may cancel, modify, or change the terms of these guidelines from time to time without notice to you. You, as a Logo user (“you"), are responsible for complying with any modified terms, so please review these guidelines and also become familiar with any modifications we publish.

The Logos are the sole and exclusive properly of openthingy Lda and its affiliates. Your use/change of any Logo implies acceptance of, and agreement with, the terms of these guidelines. If you do not accept and agree to follow the rules for using the Logos as set out in these guidelines, you do not have the right to use/change the Logos and should not use/change them. Any use of the Logos that does not comply with these guidelines is not authorized. If you violate the rules set out in these guidelines, you must cease all use and changes of all Logos, regardless of the uses and/or changes otherwise allowed in this policy. In addition, openthingy Lda reserves the right to revoke its approval of your use/changes of the logos at any time.

## All openthingy Lda Logos are distinctive, designed pieces of graphic artwork. The following usage guidelines must be followed:
1. The logos must have written "{openthingy}" on them
2. The official pallete of colors is black for "{" and "}", Pantone 2736 C for "open" and Pantone Bright Red C for "thingy". On dark backgrounds all characters must be white.
3. The colors are subject to change at your discretion unless stated otherwise.
4. Do not modify or alter the Logos (exception 3.)
5. Do not change scale, skew or rotate any Logo
6. Do not change the design of any Logo
7. Do not combine a Logo with any other design, trademark, graphic, text or other element, including your name, any trademarks or any generic terms.
8. Logos may only be placed on solid backgrounds (preferably bright white), and not over an image or pattern, and no artistic effects (such as drop shadows) may be applied.

## Business partners who have agreements with openthingy Lda must comply with the terms of their agreement in addition to this Guidelines.
